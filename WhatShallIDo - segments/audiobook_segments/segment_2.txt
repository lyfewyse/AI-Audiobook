COOPERATE WITH GOD IN YOUR SALVATION

     He draws us through His love and kindness;
       we respond by learning to know Him through study and prayer.
     He convicts of sin, righteousness, and judgment, producing guilt;
       we acknowledge our guiltiness without blaming others.
     He gives us repentance, producing true heart sorrow for sin;
       we confess with contrite hearts, surrendering all rights to self and sin. 
     He forgives and cleanses from all sin and creates a new heart and mind;
       we believe and experience cleansing and renewal. 
     He dwells in us through the Holy Spirit, energizing us to do His will;
       we act out what He works in, which results in fruit to His glory. 
     He alerts us when tempted, and empowers us to resist the tempter;
       we submit to Him and resist through His power, gaining the victory.
      He will be our Advocate and plead for us if we should fall;
       we repent and turn back to Him so He can restore us to Himself. 

     Through Christ God has worked out our complete salvation.
