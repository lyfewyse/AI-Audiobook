Chapter 11: He Will Give You Repentance
     “Him hath God exalted with his right hand to be a Prince and a Saviour, for to give repentance to Israel, and forgiveness of sins.” Acts 5:31
     “By the manifestation of His love, by the entreating of His Spirit, He woos men to repentance; for repentance is the gift of God, and whom He pardons He first makes penitent.” 1SM 324
     “Repentance includes sorrow for sin, and a turning away from it. We shall not renounce sin unless we see its sinfulness; until we turn away from it in heart, there will be no real change in the life.” SC 23
     “If my people, which are called by my name, shall humble themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways; then will I hear from heaven, and I will forgive their sin.” 2 Chron. 7:14 
     “True repentance will lead a man to bear his guilt himself and ack-nowledge it without deception or hypocrisy.” SC 40  
     When God brings us to repentance it is not difficult to confess and forsake our sins and surrender to Him.
