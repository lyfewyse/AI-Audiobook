Chapter 19: Take God’s Way of Escapeand Submit to Him
     “Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you. Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you.”                                                                                                                           James 4:7, 8     
     “Jesus gained the victory through submission and faith in God, and                                                                                                                by the apostle He says to us, ‘Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you. Draw nigh to God, and He will draw nigh to you.’ We cannot save ourselves from the tempter’s power; he has conquered humanity, and when we try to stand in our own strength, we shall become a prey to his devices; but ‘the name of the Lord is a strong tower: the righteous runneth into it, and is safe.’ Satan trembles and flees before the weakest soul who finds refuge in that mighty name.” DA 131
     “The Lord knows how to deliver the godly out of temptations.”               2 Peter 2:9
     “Human effort of itself is not sufficient. Without the aid of divine power it avails nothing. God works and man works. Resistance of temp-tation must come from man, who must draw his power from God. . . . God wishes us to have the mastery over ourselves. But He cannot help us with-out our consent and cooperation. The divine Spirit works through the powers and faculties given to man.” AA 482
     How can He work in us if we are not allowing Him to do it?
     “As soon as we incline our will to harmonize with God’s will, the grace of God stands ready to cooperate with the human agent.” HP 27
     “In the whole Satanic force there is not power to overcome one soul who in simple trust casts himself on Christ.” COL 157
     When we sense a temptation, we should quickly submit ourselves to God. He will then work in us whatever is needed for us to have the victory.  Angels of God will surround us and the temptation will lose its power.
     “Around every tempted soul there are angels of God, ready to lift up the standard of righteousness, if the tempted one will only show a spirit of resistance to evil.” RH 881907
     “By faith and prayer all may meet the requirements of the gospel. No man can be forced to transgress. His own consent must first be gained; the soul must purpose the sinful act, before passion can dominate over reason, or iniquity triumph over conscience. Temptation, however strong, is never an excuse for sin. ‘The eyes of the Lord are over the righteous, and His ears are open unto their prayers.’ Cry unto the Lord, tempted soul. Cast yourself, helpless, unworthy, upon Jesus, and claim His very promise. The Lord will hear. He knows how strong are the inclinations of the natural heart, and He will help in every time of temptation.” 5T 177
     “For in that he himself hath suffered being tempted, he is able to succour them that are tempted.” Heb. 2:18
     Every time I have taken God’s way of escape by immediately submitting   to Him when I am being tempted, He works in me the right attitude and whatever I need to keep me from falling.
