COOPERATE WITH GOD IN YOUR SALVATION

     “Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling. For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure.”        Phil. 2:12, 13
     “To make God’s grace our own, we must act our part. The Lord does not propose to perform for us either the willing or the doing. His grace is given to work in us to will and to do, but never as a substitute for our effort.  Our souls are to be aroused to cooperate. The Holy Spirit works in us, that we may work out our own salvation.” MYP 147
     The following is an outline of how we can cooperate with God.

1. God’s Part: He draws us through His love and kindness.
Our Part: We respond by learning to know Him through study and prayer.
       
2. God's Part: He convicts of sin, righteousness, and judgment, producing guilt.
Our Part: We acknowledge our guiltiness without blaming others.
       
3. God's Part: He gives us repentance, producing true heart sorrow for sin.
Our Part: We confess with contrite hearts, surrendering all rights to self and sin.
        
4. God's Part: He forgives and cleanses from all sin and creates a new heart and mind.
Our Part: We believe and experience cleansing and renewal.
        
5. He dwells in us through the Holy Spirit, energizing us to do His will.
We act out what He works in, which results in fruit to His glory.
        
6. He alerts us when tempted, and empowers us to resist the tempter;
We submit to Him and resist through His power, gaining the victory.
       
7. He will be our Advocate and plead for us if we should fall;
We repent and turn back to Him so He can restore us to Himself.
       


     As you may have noticed, all of God’s part has to do with working in our hearts while our part is to cooperate and work out what He works in. I had not understood this and so I had been trying on my own to keep my heart right. What is the first work that Jesus does to help us?
